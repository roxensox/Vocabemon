# Vocabemon
## Overview
This is a personal project for Boot.dev. I've always really liked C, but have had difficulty getting fully comfortable with it, so I decided to use it for this project. The vague idea of this is to make vocab practice kind of like pokemon, with future plans to integrate this system into a bigger project.

The goal of this project is to make detailed flashcards that will include etymological information with each word. I might make synonym-linking in each card as well, and I want to try to gamify how the flashcards work. Maybe use them like trading cards? I'm still in the idea phase and just making data structures that I might find useful.
